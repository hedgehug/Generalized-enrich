GUI window is named main_frame.java

File loading is implemented by ExpressionFileLoader, which loads a gene expression file (i.e. data/IL6.txt), 
and GeneListFileLoader, which loads a gene list file (i.e. data/IL6.up.gene)

After files loaded successfully, there's notification, this process may take a few seconds.

Next step is to Run Analysis, the gene statistics is calculated first for every gene and then compare them in
main_fram.java Compare() function, where a Comparator object will be created

The Comparator class take two objects, one is gene expression, the other one could be GeneListFileLoader or GeneExpression object
Figures and plots are generated in Comparator
